# LocoAndroid

The best library to master localisations of your android application. 


## The problem

The play store is global. So people from all over the world can install your app. There was always a big problem. 
Providing the correct translations for many different languages. So devs started to use services like localise.biz
to have a simple web ui to create new translations, and to allow collaborations.
This is great, but there is still one big downside. New translations will only be added to your app if you include
those in your app, build it again, and provide a new update. 

## The solution

Now that is the part where **LocoAndroid** is useful. Just create your application on localise.biz, allow people
to create translations, and configure it within your app. It will magically download and use the translations from
the cloud, and no further action is required.
